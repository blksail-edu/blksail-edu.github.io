# 1.4 Linear Algebra

[Linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and matrices.
It is a fundamental tool in machine learning and data science.
In this module, we will cover the basics of linear algebra, including vectors, matrices, and operations on them.


## Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices

### Scalars

A [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)) is a single number, denoted by lowercase letters (e.g., $a$, $b$, $c$).
You can think of a scalar as a quantity that has only magnitude and no direction.
For example, the temperature of a place, the number of students in a class, etc., are scalars.


### Vectors

A [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)) is an array of numbers, denoted by lowercase bold letters (e.g., $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$).
A vector has both magnitude and direction.
For example, the velocity of a moving car, the position of a point in space, etc., are vectors.
A vector can be represented as a column vector or a row vector.
A column vector is a vector with a single column, while a row vector is a vector with a single row.

$$
\mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

is a column vector, and

$$
\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

is a row vector.

The number of elements in a vector is called its dimension.
For example, a vector with $n$ elements is said to be an $n$-dimensional vector.

A row vector with $n$ elements is said to be a $1 \times n$ vector, while a column vector with $n$ elements is said to be an $n \times 1$ vector.


### Matrices

A [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) is a 2D array of numbers, denoted by uppercase bold letters (e.g., $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, $\mathbf{C}$).
A matrix can be thought of as a collection of vectors.
For example, the coefficients of a system of linear equations, the pixel values of an image, etc., are matrices.
A matrix can be represented as a collection of rows or columns.
A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is said to have dimensions $m \times n$.

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
$$

is a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.


## Operations on Vectors and Matrices

### Addition and Subtraction

Addition and subtraction of vectors and matrices are done element-wise.
For example, the sum of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ a_2 + b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

Similarly, the difference of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 - b_1 \\ a_2 - b_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n - b_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

The addition and subtraction of matrices are done in a similar way:

$$
\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & \cdots & b_{1n} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} & \cdots & b_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ b_{m1} & b_{m2} & \cdots & b_{mn} \end{bmatrix}\\
= \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} + b_{1n} \\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} + b_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} + b_{m1} & a_{m2} + b_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} + b_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
$$

:::danger

The matrices being added or subtracted must have the same dimensions.

:::


### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication of a vector or a matrix is done by multiplying each element of the vector or matrix by the scalar.
For example, the scalar multiplication of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ by a scalar $c$ is given by:

$$
c \mathbf{a} = c \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c a_1 \\ c a_2 \\ \vdots \\ c a_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

Similarly, the scalar multiplication of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by a scalar $c$ is given by:

$$
c \mathbf{A} = c \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c a_{11} & c a_{12} & \cdots & c a_{1n} \\ c a_{21} & c a_{22} & \cdots & c a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ c a_{m1} & c a_{m2} & \cdots & c a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
$$


### Matrix product

Matrix product is a bit more complex than addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
The product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & \cdots & b_{1p} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} & \cdots & b_{2p} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ b_{n1} & b_{n2} & \cdots & b_{np} \end{bmatrix}\\
= \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} b_{11} + a_{12} b_{21} + \cdots + a_{1n} b_{n1} & a_{11} b_{12} + a_{12} b_{22} + \cdots + a_{1n} b_{n2} & \cdots & a_{11} b_{1p} + a_{12} b_{2p} + \cdots + a_{1n} b_{np} \\ a_{21} b_{11} + a_{22} b_{21} + \cdots + a_{2n} b_{n1} & a_{21} b_{12} + a_{22} b_{22} + \cdots + a_{2n} b_{n2} & \cdots & a_{21} b_{1p} + a_{22} b_{2p} + \cdots + a_{2n} b_{np} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} b_{11} + a_{m2} b_{21} + \cdots + a_{mn} b_{n1} & a_{m1} b_{12} + a_{m2} b_{22} + \cdots + a_{mn} b_{n2} & \cdots & a_{m1} b_{1p} + a_{m2} b_{2p} + \cdots + a_{mn} b_{np} \end{bmatrix}
$$

The product of two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of rows in the first matrix and the number of columns equal to the number of columns in the second matrix.
i.e., if $\mathbf{A}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $\mathbf{B}$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, then the product $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}$ is an $m \times p$ matrix.

:::danger

The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for matrix product to be defined.

:::

:::info

Matrix product is not commutative, i.e., $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} \neq \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$ in general.

:::

#### Dot Product of Vectors

The dot product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is a special case of matrix product.
The dot product of two vectors is given by:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \cdots + a_n b_n
$$

### Transpose

The transpose of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is obtained by interchanging its rows and columns.
The transpose of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is denoted by $\mathbf{A}^T$.

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{A}^T = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} & \cdots & a_{m1} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{m2} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{1n} & a_{2n} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}
$$


### Magnitude of a Vector

The magnitude of a vector $\mathbf{a}$ is given by:

$$
\| \mathbf{a} \| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2}
$$

The magnitude of a vector is also known as the Euclidean norm or the $L^2$ norm.

:::info

The magnitude of a vector is always a non-negative number.

Velocity and acceleration are examples of vector quantities that have magnitude.

## Linear Algebra in Python

Python provides several libraries for linear algebra operations, such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
NumPy is a popular library for numerical computing in Python and provides support for arrays, matrices, and linear algebra operations.
We will use NumPy for performing linear algebra operations in Python.

In the same virtual environment where you used in the previous modules (`python-refresher`), install NumPy using the following command:

```bash
workon python-refresher # Activate the virtual environment
pip install numpy
```

Now, you can use NumPy in your Python scripts by importing it as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
```

### Vectors and Matrices in NumPy

You can create vectors and matrices in NumPy using the `np.array()` function.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a vector
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(f"Vector a: {a}")

# Create a matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(f"Matrix A: {A}")
```

### Operations on Vectors and Matrices in NumPy

You can perform operations on vectors and matrices in NumPy, such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and transpose.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create vectors
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Create matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Addition of vectors
sum_vector = a + b
print(f"Sum of vectors a and b: {sum_vector}")

# Subtraction of vectors
diff_vector = a - b
print(f"Difference of vectors a and b: {diff_vector}")

# Dot product of vectors
dot_product = np.dot(a, b)
print(f"Dot product of vectors a and b: {dot_product}")

# Addition of matrices
sum_matrix = A + B
print(f"Sum of matrices A and B: {sum_matrix}")

# Subtraction of matrices
diff_matrix = A - B
print(f"Difference of matrices A and B: {diff_matrix}")

# Scalar multiplication of vectors
c = 2
scalar_mult_vector = c * a
print(f"Scalar multiplication of vector a by {c}: {scalar_mult_vector}")

# Scalar multiplication of matrices
scalar_mult_matrix = c * A
print(f"Scalar multiplication of matrix A by {c}: {scalar_mult_matrix}")

# Matrix multiplication
product_matrix = np.dot(A, B)
print(f"Product of matrices A and B: {product_matrix}")

# Transpose of a matrix
transpose_matrix = A.T
print(f"Transpose of matrix A: {transpose_matrix}")
```

### Magnitude of a Vector in NumPy

You can calculate the magnitude of a vector in NumPy using the `np.linalg.norm()` function.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a vector
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Calculate the magnitude of the vector
magnitude = np.linalg.norm(a)
print(f"Magnitude of vector a: {magnitude}")
```
