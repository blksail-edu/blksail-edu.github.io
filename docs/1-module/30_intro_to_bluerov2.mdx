# 1.3 BlueROV2 Platform

## UUVs
Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are vehicles that operate underwater without a human pilot on board.
Remotely operated vehicles (ROV), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), and gliders are UUVs and have numerous applications, especially in a water environment, most commonly the ocean.


Autonomous vehicles are preprogrammed with missions, allowing the vehicle to operate independently for hours or days.
They can navigate appropriately using GPS at the surface and internal navigation systems when underwater.
Depending on the type and duration of the mission, the AUVs can surface throughout the mission and send data back to the team via satellite.
Due to the independent nature of these applications, the robots are untethered. Autonomous vehicles can perform a variety of missions, such as:
- Seafloor mapping
- Environmental
- Climate research
- Pipeline and cable surveys
- Military applications
- Archaeology/Oceanographic and exploration missions

ROVs require a tether and a team, especially a pilot at the surface to control the vehicle.
The team is either above the surface on a boat or a platform.
 An advantage of an ROV is the real-time control and live feed.
 These vehicles can also carry manipulators, sonars, and sampling devices, allowing the pilot to directly interact with the undersea environment.
ROVs have many main uses, including:
- Inspection and maintenance
- Search and recovery
- Scientific research
- Construction Support
- Environmental Monitoring

This ROV is equipped with sensors, video and still imaging systems, lighting, and numerous sampling systems.
The manipulator arm allows for the collection of rock, sediment, and marine life, which can then be passed to the surface for further examination.</small>*

## BlueROV2
The BlueROV2 is an affordable, remotely (or autonomously) operated vehicle.
These vehicles are primarily used for exploratory missions.
