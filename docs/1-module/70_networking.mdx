## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Chat Application

In Python, implement a chat application (server and client) that allows users to send messages in a common chat room.

:::note

Fork the [chat application](https://github.com/blksail-edu/simple-chat-app) repository and clone it to your local machine.

You will be working in a team setup, so make sure to coordinate with your team members.
One fork per team.
Each team member should be working on a separate branch.

:::

#### Requirements

- The server should be able to handle multiple clients at once.
- The server should broadcast messages to all clients.
- The server should send a message to the chatroom when a new client joins the chat room.
- The server should send a message to the chatroom when a client leaves the chat room.
- The client should be able to send messages to the server.
- The client should be able to receive messages from the server.
- The client should be able to gracefully exit the chat room.
- The client should have a username, which is sent to the server when the client joins the chat room.
- The server should keep track of all clients in the chat room.
- The client is defined by:

  - username
  - IP address
  - password
  - unique ID

- The server is defined by:

  - IP address
  - port

- A message in the chat room is defined by:

  - sender (the client ID)
  - payload (the message)
  - timestamp
  - chatroom ID
  - unique ID

- The chat room is defined by:

  - name
  - unique ID

#### Hints

Here's a class diagram to help you get started:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Client {
    +String: username
    +String: ip_address
    +String: password
    +String: uuid
  }

  class Server {
    +String: ip_address
    +Number: port
  }

  class Message {
    +String: sender
    +String: payload
    +Date: timestamp
    +String: chatroom_id
    +String: uuid
  }

  class Chatroom {
    +String: name
    +String: uuid
    +List<Message>: messages
  }

```

You should at least have the following files:

- `chat_server.py`
  This is the main file that runs the server.
- `chat_client.py`
  This is the main file that runs the client.
- `client.py`
  This is the client class.
- `server.py`
  This is the server class.
- `message.py`
  This is the message class.
- `chatroom.py`
  This is the chatroom class.

Here's a sequence diagram to help you get started:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C0 as Client 0
    participant S as Server
    participant C1 as Client 1

    C0->>S: Authenticate
    activate S
    S->>C0: Authenticate OK
    S->>C0: Broadcast New Client
    deactivate S

    C0->>S: Send Message
    activate S
    S->>C0: Message Received
    S->>C0: Broadcast Message
    deactivate S

    C1->>S: Authenticate
    activate S
    S->>C1: Authenticate OK
    S->>C0: Broadcast New Client
    S->>C1: Broadcast New Client
    deactivate S

    C1->>S: Send Message
    activate S
    S->>C1: Message Received
    S->>C0: Broadcast Message
    S->>C1: Broadcast Message
    deactivate S

    C0->>S: Disconnect
    activate S
    S->>C0: Disconnect OK
    S->>C1: Broadcast Client Disconnected
    deactivate S

    C1->>S: Disconnect
    activate S
    S->>C1: Disconnect OK
    deactivate S
```
