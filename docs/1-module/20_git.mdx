# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used in software development to manage changes to source code and collaborate with other developers.
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes made to the codebase, and merge changes made by different developers.
In this module, we will introduce the basic concepts of Git and how to use it effectively in your projects.
