## Using `raspi-config`

1. Open the terminal and type `sudo raspi-config` .
2. Select `1 System Options`.
3. Select `S1 Wireless LAN`.
4. Enter the SSID of the network you want to connect to and press enter.
5. Enter the password of the network you want to connect to and press enter.
6. Select `OK` and press enter.
7. Select `Finish` and press enter.
8. Reboot the Raspberry Pi by typing `sudo reboot` in the terminal.

## Editing the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file

1. Open the terminal and type `sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` .
2. Add the following lines to the file:

```
network={
  ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
  psk="YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"
}
```

3. Reboot the Raspberry Pi by typing `sudo reboot` in the terminal.
