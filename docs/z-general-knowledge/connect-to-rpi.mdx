## Ping the RPi

To check if the RPi is connected to the network, you can ping it.
To do so, open a terminal and type:

```bash
ping backseat.local
```

If you get a response, you are on the same network as the RPi and it is powered on.

If you don't get a response, check the following:

1. Is the RPi powered on? The red LED should be on.
   The red LED is the power LED. If it is not on, the RPi is not powered on.
2. Does your computer show a network interface `RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget`?
   If not, you need to install the driver for the RPi USB OTG.
3. Does your operating system support [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)?
   If not, you need to use the IP address of the RPi instead of `backseat.local`.

## SSH into the RPi

To connect to the RPi, you can use SSH.
To do so, open a terminal and type:

```bash
ssh blue@backseat.local
```

The default password is `iamblue`.

:::note

If you are using Windows, you need to install an SSH client.

You can also connect with the username you created during the setup.
