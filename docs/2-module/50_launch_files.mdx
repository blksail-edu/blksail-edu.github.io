# 2.5 Launch Files

Launch files in ROS 2 are used to start multiple instances of nodes using a single terminal command. These files save you time by eliminating the need to open X terminals to ros2 run X nodes.

## Creating a Launch File

1. In your first ROS 2 package called `tutorial`, create a new directory called `launch`. Inside this `launch` subdirectory, create a new file called `example.launch.yaml`.

2. Inside of `example.launch.yaml`, add the following code:

```yaml
launch:

- node:
    pkg: "tutorial"
    exec: "publisher"
    name: "tutorial_publisher"
    namespace: ""

- node:
    pkg: "tutorial"
    exec: "subscriber"
    name: "tutorial_subscriber"
    namespace: ""
```

:::info

YAML launch files in ROS 2 are structured so that you may specify multiple nodes defined using their executable and package. You may also rename the node from inside the launch file, or add a namespace to the node.

:::

3. Now open your `setup.py` file. Inside this file, you must specify to build the launch files inside the `launch` subdirectory.

Add the following imports at the top of the file:

```py
import os
import glob
```

Then, in the `data_files` argument in the `setup` call, add the following line:

```py
(os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*'))
```

such that the argument looks like:

```py
data_files=[
    ('share/ament_index/resource_index/packages',
        ['resource/' + package_name]),
    ('share/' + package_name, ['package.xml']),
    (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*'))
],
```

4. Compile the package and test your launch file:

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws && colcon build --packages-select tutorial
source install/setup.zsh
```

```zsh
ros2 launch tutorial example.launch.yaml
```

In the terminal, you should see that both the publisher and subscriber nodes have started running. When you shutdown the launch file, all associated nodes will also stop running.
