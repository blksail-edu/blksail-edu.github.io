# 2.4 ArduSub & ROSMAV

In this section we cover how to connect to the BlueROV2 using a custom `rosmav` interface. This interface uses the `MAVLINK` communication protocal inside of a ROS 2 node to talk to the "*frontseat*" onboard the vehicle.

## Configuring ROSMAV

1. First, create a new virutal environment for the `rosmav` interface.

```zsh
mkvirtualenv rosmav --system-site-packages
workon rosmav
```

2. Install the following libraries in the `rosmav` virtual environment.

```zsh
pip install cv_bridge numpy pymavlink
```

3. Now, clone the `rosmav` repository into the `src` directory of your `auvc_ws`.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src && git clone https://github.com/blksaild-edu/rosmav
```

4. Install ROS 2 dependencies:

```zsh
cd ../ && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

5. Compile the `rosmav` package and source the workspace.

```zsh
colcon build --packages-select rosmav && source install/setup.zsh
```

## Launching ROSMAV

After building the `rosmav` package, test the interface by running the following command in a terminal on the backseat:

```zsh
ros2 run rosmav ros_bluerov2_interface
```

If the command runs successfully, you should see the following output:

```zsh
[INFO] [1721669754.194733875] [ros_bluerov2_interface]: Heartbeat from system 1, component 0
```


## Problem Set

For this problem set, please first create a new ROS 2 package named `tutorial_ardusub` to contain any new nodes that you create.

### Problem One

In your `tutorial_ardusub` package, create a new node called `bluerov2_sensors.py`. This node should do the following:

1. Subscribe to the battery sensor messages.
2. Subscribe to the inertial measurement unit \(IMU\) sensor messages.
3. Use attributes that are updated on subscription callbacks.
4. Output a warning in the terminal when the battery has fallen below a safe voltage.

When both `ArduSub` and `ROSMAV` are running on the `backseat`, the `SITL` will send simulated messages that you can use to test your node.

### Problem Two

Open `QGroundControl` on your Windows or macOs machine. You should see the BlueROV2 somewhere along the United State's west coast. This BlueROV2 is the `SITL` running on the `backseat`.

If it is not already running, start your node from **Problem One**.

In `QGroundControl`, arm the BlueROV2 and change its flight mode to `GUIDED`. Click any arbitrary point in the water and select `Go to location`. After holding down your space bar or dragging the slider, you should see the BlueROV2 moving.

Open a new terminal on the `backseat` and use the `ros2 topic echo` command to inspect the available topics. Also pay attention to your node. What do you observe?
