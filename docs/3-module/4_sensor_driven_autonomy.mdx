# Sensor-Driven Autonomy

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) is a set of open source tools for simulating robots in an environment.
It is commonly used in robotics research and education.

We will be using Gazebo to simulate the robot (BlueROV2) in a virtual (pool) environment.

:::note

We will be using Gazebo Garden, the latest version of Gazebo.

:::

## Installation

The documentation for installing Gazebo can be found [here](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install).
See "**Binary Installation**" for instructions on installing Gazebo on your operating system.
Below is a summary of the steps.

:::note

Only Ubuntu is fully supported by Gazebo.
macOS is partially supported.
In Windows, the simulation will run, but the GUI will not work.

:::

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

First we need to install ruby from Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

Then we have to add the Homebrew Ruby to our path:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now, we add the `osrf/simulation` tap:

```bash
brew tap osrf/simulation
```

:::tip Apple Silicon-based Macs

For Apple Silicon-based Macs, we need to modify the Formulae before installing Gazebo.

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/osrf/homebrew-simulation/Formula
sed -i '' 's|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath}"|cmake_args << "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=#{rpath};/opt/homebrew/lib"|' *.rb
```

:::

Next we install Gazebo:

```bash
brew install gz-garden
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

First let's update and install some dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lsb-release wget gnupg
```

Next we install the Gazebo package repository:

```bash
sudo wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null
```

Finally, we install Gazebo:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gz-garden
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Test the installation

To test your installation, run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -s shapes.sdf
```

In another terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 -g
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

In one terminal, run:

```bash
gz sim -v4 shapes.sdf
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see a window pop up with some 3D objects in it.

## Our custom simulation

We built a custom simulation for the BlueROV2.
It lives in this repository: [gazebo_bluerov2](https://github.com/blksail-edu/gazebo_bluerov2).

Clone the repository into your workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blksail-edu/gazebo_bluerov2
```

Build the simulation:

```bash
cd gazebo_bluerov2
./build.sh
```

Start the example simulation:

```bash
./launch.sh
```

:::warning

Sometimes, the simulation will not quit properly.
If this happens, you will need to kill the process manually.

```bash
pkill -9 gz
```

## Controlling the robot

Try controlling the depth of robot now with `depth_control.py` you previously wrote.

First, in the `backseat`, start the `SITL`:

```bash
cd PATH_TO_ARDUSUB
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -L RATBeach -v ArduSub -f vectored --model=JSON --out=udp:SIMULATION_COMPUTER_IP:14550 --console
```

Run your `depth_control.py` script in another terminal:

```bash
python3 depth_control.py
```

You should see the robot dive to the desired depth.
