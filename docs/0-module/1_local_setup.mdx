# Local Setup

For this course, you will need a Mac or Ubuntu (GNU/Linux) machine.

:::note

If you are using Windows, you can run Ubuntu inside Windows thanks to [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Package Manager

First, let's get a package manager to help install the software that will be needed.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

macOS doesn't come with a package manager by default, so we will install
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install software by running:

```bash
brew install <package-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

Ubuntu comes with a package manager called `apt`. To install software, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install <package-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Visual Studio Code

We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our
code editor.

To install it, run:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
sudo apt install code
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Docker

We will be using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run our code in a
consistent environment.

To install it, run:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Python

We will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) as one of our programming languages.
Python is a popular programming language that is used for many different things: from web development to data science.
It is an interpreted language, which means that it is not compiled: it is run directly.

Python 3 is the latest version of Python.
It should be installed by default on macOS and Ubuntu.

To check if you have Python 3 installed, run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Pip

[Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) is the package manager for Python.

To check if you have Pip installed, run:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If you don't have Pip installed, you can install it by running:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install pip
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## C++

We will be using [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) as one of our programming languages.
C++ is a popular programming language that is used for many different things: from embedded systems to video games.
It is a compiled language, which means that it is compiled into machine code before it is run.

### CLang

[CLang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is a compiler for C++.
A compiler is a program that takes code written in a programming language and turns it into machine code.

To check if you have CLang installed, run:

```bash
clang --version
```

If you don't have CLang installed, you can install it by running:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install llvm
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
sudo apt install clang
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a build system for C++.
A build system is a program that organizes the compilation of a project.

To check if you have CMake installed, run:

```bash
cmake --version
```

If you don't have CMake installed, you can install it by running:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

```bash
brew install cmake
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```

</TabItem>
